## Project Explanation
  This project focuses on Q-learning algorithms. We are tasked with implementing a Q-learning algorithm for an agent (a pirate) that needs to solve a maze to reach the goal (a treasure). We are given, essentially, a working solution minus the training algorithm. We have code that handles experience replay, visual output, agent actions (moving around in the maze), game status checks, etc. The missing piece is the algorithm that makes the agent learn. Using the given framework, I created an algorithm that successfully trains the agent to solve the maze.
