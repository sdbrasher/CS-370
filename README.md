AI trends in Computer Science

## Project Overview
  This project focuses on Q-learning algorithms. I was tasked with implementing a Q-learning algorithm for an agent (a pirate) that needs to solve a maze to reach the goal (a treasure). I was given, essentially, a working solution minus the training algorithm. We have code that handles experience replay, visual output, agent actions (moving around in the maze), game status checks, reward checks, etc. The missing piece is the algorithm that makes the agent learn. Using the given framework, I created an algorithm that successfully trains the agent to solve the maze.
  
## Reflection
  Computer scientists work to design, develop, implement, and maintain computer systems and applications. Given how ubiquitous computers are in our modern society, and how their use is prevelant in crucial fields like healthcare, energy generation, finance, and government, their work is critical. As a computer scientist, I try to analyze how a problem can be solved by the algorithmic actions of a computer. There are also ethical concerns to consider, especially given the nature of the work. As we become a more data-focused society, protecting user data has become paramount. In the context of artificial intelligence, I believe one key aspect of maintaining an ethical relationship between user and system is transparent systems, where the user can understand how their data is being used.
